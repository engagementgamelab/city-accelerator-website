        <p class="c-article__intro">Chart the Course is a role-playing game used to encourage organizational learning about public engagement through creative brainstorming and empathy-building.</p>
        <p>Players strategize and create plans for engagement by selecting from different tactics promoting engagement, including open data research, social media campaigns, and street polling to connect with their community members about pressing civic issues such as public safety, education, and affordable housing. Over the course of 45 minutes, players decide whether to emphasize transparency, creativity, or inclusivity in their plans.</p>

      <h2>How to play</h2>
			<p>The object of the game is to create a public engagement plan that sufficiently meets the community’s needs, in order to build trust with them. Players represent a team of Capital City public engagement planners tasked with developing an engagement strategy for a project. Public engagement can be a “messy” and evolving process, with necessarily limited resources of time, energy, and funding. Players must decide whether to invest in approaches that emphasize Transparency, Creativity, or Inclusivity. Along the way, players encounter feedback from members of the public, variously satisfied with your approach. The players’ ability to anticipate and respond to the public’s needs will earn their trust and allow you to bank points in the game.</p>
